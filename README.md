## Description
This code is divided into three directories, in each is the code for different part of the manuscript. The codes are parted to different scripts, which are performing the analyses and plotting the main figures in the manuscript 

# STEP 1 - Analyses related to Figure 1
Scripts to run (to reproduce Figure 1 results):
1. FIGURE1A
2. FIGURE1B
3. FIGURE1C
4. FIGURE1D

# STEP 2 - Analyses related to Figures 2-3
Scripts to run (to reproduce Figure 2-3 results):
1. FIGURE2A
2. FIGURE2B
3. FIGURE2D
4. FIGURE3AB
5. FIGURE3CD

# STEP 3 - Analyses related to Figures 4-5
1. FIGURE4A
2. FIGURE4BDE
3. FIGURE4C
4. FIGURE5ABC
5. FIGURE5DE
6. FIGURE5F
